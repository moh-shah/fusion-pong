"A test project to write an online Pong with Photon Fusion"

How to run the game:
Use Parallel sync or build standalone so you can run multiple instances.
Play the game when the Lobby scene is opened.
On one instance, press "Host a Game" button.
On the other one, press "Join a Game".

Although I tried to write a readable code-base, but it's a fast-written prototype. So do not expect a super well-structured arcitecture!
