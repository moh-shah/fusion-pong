<b>A test project to write an online Pong with Photon Fusion</b>

How to run the game:
- Use Parallel sync or build standalone so you can run multiple instances.
- Enter play mode when the Lobby scene is opened (if running on the editor).
- On one instance, press "Host a Game" button.
- On the other one, press "Join a Game".

It's a fast-written prototype. Although I tried not to write nasty code, do not expect a super well-structured code architecture!
